== Interface ==
    * Every single method declared in an interface must be implemented by the subclass
    * What an object can do

== Abstract/Derived Class ==
    * What an object is
    * Only abstract methods must be implemented
    * If an abstract class only has abstract methods is it an interface??? Yes???

== Polymorphism ==
    * Processing objects differently depending on their data type or class

== Abstraction ==
    * The process of generalization: taking a concrete implementation and making it applicable to different types of data.
    * Example: qsort - It doesn't care/know what data type it is sorting.

== Inheritance ==
    * Implements 'is a'
    * Classes can be derived from other classes, inheriting methods and variables from them.

== Encapsulation ==
    * Objects encapsulate their state and data to hide it from outside.
    * Outside users of the class inteact with the object through its methods (getters and setters)
